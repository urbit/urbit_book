#Introduction: What is a Personal Cloud Computer?

>**Burnham's law of platform warfare:**  
>General-purpose beats special-purpose. Personal beats industrial. Cloud beats ground.

A PC2 is any general-purpose machine, physical or virtual, that operates
natively on the Internet (cloud), and whose operation is sufficiently simple
that it can be understood and controlled by the user (personal). 

The PC2 is general-purpose, in that it can run programs and applications that
perform an unlimited range of functions. This is contrasted with special-purpose
platforms, such as a pocket calculator or consumer web application, that can
only perform a single function, or limited range of related functions.

The PC2 is personal, in that the ordinary user can understand its operation
without requiring a high degree of specialized technical skill. This is
contrasted with industrial platforms, such a Linux server, whose computational
semantics are rendered largely opaque by their complexity, even (or especially) to the technically skillful.

The PC2 is a cloud computer, in that it intrinsically operates on a network and
blurs the distinction between network and local resources. This is contrasted
with non-network, or ground, computers, such as the early personal computer,
which maintains a sharp distinction between data on its own disk and data on
the network.

The individual user can easily setup and administer a PC2 on their own, run and
write a endless variety of applications, and can not only can access their
programs and data seamlessly from any client, but can serve any kind of content
to all other clients on the network. Meaning that all programs running on a
PC2 can communicate with programs running on different PC2's as easily as they
can communicate with programs on the same PC2. The PC2 is not just a
general-purpose client, it is also a general-purpose server. In other words, a
network of PC2's is, by definition, a general-purpose social network. 

By no means is this concept an idea original to Urbit. Many, many systems
desinged to implement the PC2 have been tried and, without exception, have
failed to do so. These previous attempts have been crippled by their inadequate
solution two fundamental problems: software portability and network identity.

Portable software can be trivially executed with the same semantics on any
general-purpose computer. One can transfer portable from one machine to any
other machine, and expect it to produce the same output. If the two machines
differ in their output, it is easy to see which one is correct and which has an 
an implementation error.

In contrast, unportable sofware must be modified for each platform
it is run on without any expectation of identical semantics on different
platforms and with complex chains of dependency on other software tools and
libraries, also ususally different per platform.

Unportable software drastically increases complexity, making it difficult for
ordinary users to understand and administer their own general-purpose computer
and incentivizing them to use special-purpose applications and services
administered by others. A lack of portability makes the goal of
indifference to resource locality almost impossible to acheive.
