\noindent \emph{``Man is a Tool-using Animal. Weak in himself, and of small stature, he stands
on a basis, at most for the flattest-soled, of some half-square foot,
insecurely enough; has to straddle out his legs, lest the very wind supplant
him. Feeblest of bipeds! Three quintals are a crushing load for him; the
steer of the meadow tosses him aloft, like a waste rag. Nevertheless he can use
Tools; can devise Tools: with these the granite mountain melts into light dust
before him; he kneads glowing iron, as if it were soft paste; seas are his
smooth highway, winds and fire his unwearying steeds. Nowhere do you find him
without Tools; without Tools he is nothing, with Tools he is all.''}

\chapter{Preface: Urbit}

\begin{quote}
\noindent A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a
simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true:
A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to
work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.

Urbit is a general-purpose programming environment designed to execute a purely
functional network operating system and a referentially transparent network
address space.

Urbit consists of four conceptual levels:

At the lowest-level, Urbit reduces to Nock, a stateless virtual machine based
on combinatory logic and defined in 340 bytes. The Nock machine is sealed -
all execution is ``pure.'' Nock's goal is extreme commoditization of computing
semantics.

Nock acts as our functional equivalent of assembly language. Nock is differs
from assembly language in that itâ€™s interpreted, rather than directly executed
by the hardware. It is like assembly language in that everything in Urbit
executes as Nock and most programming in Urbit will be done using higher-level
tools that reduce to Nock.

Hoon is a high-level language which defines itself in Nock. Its self-compiling
kernel, 7000 lines of code, specifies Hoon unambiguously; there is no Hoon
spec. Hoon can be classified as a pure, strict higher-order static
type-inferred functional language, with co/contra/bivariance and genericity.
However, Hoon does not use lambda calculus, unification, or other constructs
from ``PL theory.'' 

Hoon also excels at handling and validating untyped data, a common task on the
Internet. Its syntax is entirely novel and initially quite frightening a
consequence of Hoon having been designed to optimize for actual usability
rather than cosmetic friendliness. A frequent experience amongst Hoon
programmers is writing code that works the first time it successfully compiles.

Arvo is a deterministic functional operating system and network protocol,
written in 5000 lines of Hoon. Arvo features a revision control filesystem and
the network is a blocking global immutable namespace. Meaning that all data on
the network or off it can be treated as a constant. Additionally, Arvo
preserves a log of all the events it sees, meaning that all computation on an
Arvo instance is recorded and can be played back and examined.
